This project presents a comprehensive AI-driven framework for stock market prediction by combining time-series forecasting, financial risk analysis, and sentiment evaluation. 
The primary goal is to provide intelligent and reliable Buy, Hold, or Sell investment recommendations using structured financial data and unstructured textual information. 
The system was developed and tested on three major Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange: Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Infosys.
At the core of the model lies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that forecasts next-day stock prices using over a decade of historical data (2010–2024).
The dataset includes technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, and log returns.
Data preprocessing involves cleaning, normalization (Min-Max scaling), and stationarity enforcement using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
The model achieved impressive prediction performance with R² scores between 0.85 and 0.92,
showing its effectiveness in capturing both long- and short-term price trends, even during periods of high market volatility.
Alongside price prediction, a Risk Management Module evaluates a company's financial health using five key indicators: 
Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, Operating Margin, Beta, and ESG Score. These values are normalized and weighted to generate a composite risk score using a shallow neural model. 
This module helps investors gauge the financial exposure and operational efficiency of a company. For example, Reliance exhibited medium risk,
while TCS and Infosys showed higher risk scores due to market sensitivity and leverage levels.
To incorporate public opinion and behavioral trends, a Sentiment Analysis Module processes text data from news headlines and Twitter posts. 
The model, built using an LSTM-based NLP classifier, categorizes each document as having positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
Sentiment scores are averaged for each company and used to reflect market mood. TCS received the most positive sentiment, while Reliance and Infosys showed more neutral results, 
revealing varied investor perceptions.
The final stage of the pipeline integrates all three outputs — predicted price, financial risk, and sentiment — into a Decision-Making Deep Neural Network (DNN).
This DNN uses ReLU activation in hidden layers and softmax at the output layer to classify investment decisions. 
The system was trained on labeled investment outcomes and successfully delivered strategic decisions: 
TCS was recommended as "Buy", whereas Reliance and Infosys were marked "Hold".
Overall, this project proves the potential of combining deep learning, financial modeling, and sentiment analysis into a unified tool for financial forecasting and strategic stock decision-making. 
It highlights how AI can transform investment analysis by integrating quantitative models with qualitative insights. The framework is scalable and can be expanded to include real-time data streaming, 
attention mechanisms, hybrid LSTM-Transformer models, or reinforcement learning for automated trading strategies.
